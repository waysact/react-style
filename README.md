# React Style

React Style is an approach for styling [React][] components.

Define styles using full power of JavaScript:

    var ReactStyle = require('react-style')

    var styles = ReactStyle({
      color: 'red',
      backgroundColor: 'white'
    })

Style React components:

    var React = require('react')

    var HelloWorld = React.createClass({

      render() {
        var dynamicStyles = ReactStyle({color: this.props.color})
        return <div styles={[styles, dynamicStyles]}>Hello, world!</div>
      }
    })

By default styles are applied to the DOM as inline styles.

## Extracting styles into CSS at build time

There's [React Style Webpack plugin][] which extends [Webpack][] with the
ability to extract styles from your application at build time. The result is a
`bundle.css` file which can be added to `<head>`.

Generated CSS class names are descriptive by default and minimized when using
`NODE_ENV=production`.

Source Maps are supported, but only for the generated JavaScript.

## Syntax helpers for writing styles

There's [React Style syntax][] which allows you to write styles like this:

    var styles = ReactStyle`
      color: red;
      background-color: white;
    `

And have it transformed into:

    var styles = ReactStyle({
      color: 'red',
      backgroundColor: 'white'
    })

This syntax is consistent with [ES6 tagged template literal][es6-templ]

The syntax helpers are convenient when transitioning a large CSS
code base to React Style. It makes it possible to directly copy paste styles 
from your CSS and later refactor them into a more modular form.

## What's wrong with CSS/SCSS/less?


## Not supported CSS features

React Style does not support CSS selectors, pseudo-classes, media-queries
and CSS animation. Mostly because we try to avoid implicit behaviour and
want the user to make layout decisions inside the `render()` function.

CSS selectors introduce implicit behaviour by not having a direct link with
the elements on which they're applied. Therefore there is no way of knowing
what the consequences are, and this easily leads to refactoring issues. Instead
you should be using plain JavaScript variables.

Classes with pseudo-classes have a higher precedence then classes with no
pseudo-classes, which results in issues if you want to override styling in
"higher-level" components. In some cases(`:before`, `after`, etc.) a component
is easily added, in others (`active`, `focus`, `hover`, etc) plain JavaScript
will do the trick. In all, you don't need CSS for this. In some cases though
you might want to use pseudo-classes (like styling a scrollbar) - which we do
support.

Media-queries are easily implemented inside the `render` function, using
`Screen.width` for example. This is however not possible server side, so
there are some setbacks to not supporting media-queries.

Animations inside CSS also introduce implicit behaviour, as CSS animations are
decoupled from logic. By being decoupled, the state of the component is split
between the component and the CSS animation. We however believe state should be
contained within a component.

## React Style and React Router

Work in progress...

## React Style and React Hot Loader

It's possible to use React Style with React Hot Loader, when you don't use
react-style-webpack-plugin. If you do want to build CSS with React Style and
use React Hot Loader - we recommend making multiple webpack profiles.
